<p class="heading">The Vision</p>
<p>The vision of IIT Mandi is to spearhead cutting edge research and development of technolo-
gies needed by the world in the years to come. Research groups will work together in creat-
ing and harnessing the newest technologies needed to serve the people of the region and the
country, to tackle problems of global importance. In order to achieve excellence and high
impact locally and globally, IIT Mandi will strongly foster inter-disciplinary R&D. With a view to
innovating sustainable technologies for widespread use, IIT Mandi will encourage strong
Humanities and Social Sciences participation in technology R&D.
</p>
<p class="heading">Thrust areas</p>
<p>The initial thrust will be in the following areas:<br>
<ul>
<li>Materials for electronics and electrical engineering, including
	meta-materials and nano-materials
</li>

<li>Energy-efficient and environmentally sound infrastructure for the
    Himalayan region (renewable energy systems, buildings, transport
    networks, waste management, water resources management, etc.)
</li>

<li>Technologies, including IT and communications, for sustainable
    development (including disaster management and increasing the
    viability of fruit and vegetable growing through
    mechanisation/biotech and post-harvest value addition)
</li>

</ul>
<p>Other research areas of interest include:
Structures, manufacturing, engineering design, controls, IT and
network security, networks and communications, computer vision,
cryptography, VLSI, large software systems, technical communication,
economics, sociology, organisational psychology, entrepreneurship,
finance, policy studies, pure mathematics, statistics.
</p>
<p>We are recruiting faculty who are interested in any of these focus
areas and have a proven track record relevant to it.  Individuals who
combine a strong academic record with a few years of relevant industry
experience, particularly in design and manufacturing, will be
preferred.
</p>
<p>
Exceptional candidates in other areas may also be considered.
</p>

<p class="heading">The Opportunities</p>
<p>
You are a faculty member in an IIT or other good University in mid career. You have estab-
lished an impressive record of academic achievement, teaching and /or research. You are
bubbling with ideas. IIT Mandi offers a unique opportunity for you to build from scratch the
research group or the academic programme of your dreams. The only IIT in the Himalayas,
the serene valleys of Kamand are a clean slate for you to help build a unique IIT.
Remote from the distractions of city life, at IIT Mandi you will find a quiet environment in
which you and your colleagues can immerse yourselves in your pursuit of academic excel-
lence. Despite its remoteness, IIT Mandi will offer the full services and conveniences that
you expect in a modern technological university. These will be provided by an efficient ad-
ministration that frees you from the overheads often associated with academic appointments.
The Himalayan location will
be a particular attraction to
visiting researchers.
IIT
Mandi is already talking with
select European Universi-
ties, and faculty members
will be encouraged to de-
velop global collaborations.
We expect the campus to be
buzzing with talks, seminars
and discussions. IIT Mandi is
also establishing partnership
agreements with industrial
research labs in India.
Again, exchange of re-
searchers will be a key part
of these partnerships.
Create a Research
Group
</p>
<!--
A pine forest in the campus
If your vision is to create a research group that will be known worldwide, that will make a
lasting impact, you may choose one of the focus themes or define your own focus. IIT Mandi
will help you with the key ingredients: funding, researchers, collaboration and administration.
Support will include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
generous seed funding to setup and operate your research facility
special research collaboration arrangements with select European Universities
special research collaboration partnerships with select industrial research labs in India
Institute support to get external funding
freedom to recruit faculty and research scholars for your group
appointments and joint appointments of faculty in Schools that will facilitate inter-
disciplinary research
low-friction administrative support
Craft an Academic Programme
If you think teaching is important, so do we. If you wish to create an innovative academic
degree programme, IIT Mandi will provide the framework. You can look forward to,
•
•
•
recognition for innovation in teaching
a flexible credit system that can be tailored to different programmes
support for labs, educational technology and development of teaching materials
Apart from academic activities, if you wish to take on a broader challenge, you can participate
in some administrative capacity required for building and sustenance of the Institute, its ac-
tivities, and its people.

Practical Matters
IIT Mandi will offer a comfortable life for its staff and their families. The only thing you it will
not give you is life in a bustling and crowded metropolis.
For your children, Mandi town (1⁄2 hour from the Kamand campus) has a well-established
DAV school and a Kendra Vidyalaya. Indus School, currently upto 5th Std, plans to grow upto
Plus 2 with CBSE syllabus. Two other Central Board schools are 45 and 60 minutes from the
campus. There are 2 good English-medium nursery schools in Mandi. IIT plans to have a
creche and primary school on the campus. We would also try to attract another high school
on or near the campus.
Mandi does not boast of big industry and higher educational institutions, so opportunities for
spouses may be limited. But for the same reason Mandi, and in the future Kamand, will be
ideal for work in education, for running an NGO, for writers and painters and social workers,
for doctors and for anyone who can work via the Internet. IIT will have R&D projects particu-
larly in ICT and policy research that would offer opportunities for a spouse with expertise in
technology and also humanities and social sciences. For a spouse with a PhD, a part-time or
regular faculty appointment would be an option.
Mandi town has unusually comprehensive shopping given its small size. Of course, it lacks
the malls and cosmopolitan choice of the big cities. For these one has to go to Shimla or
Chandigarh. Mandi has many doctors and some hospitals/clinics. The IIT campus will have
basic medical facilities. The nearest specialty hospitals are in Shimla and Chandigarh.
Kullu, about an hour away has an airport with a few flights in the morning. No doubt as IIT
grows frequency of flights will increase.
In the End
If you love the mountains, if
you have a passion for
research and education, if
you have dreamt of building
a new Institute, if you desire
to contribute to the growth of
higher learning in India, a
unique and rare opportunity
has presented itself. To take
