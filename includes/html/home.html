<p class="heading">The Vision</p>
<p>The vision of IIT Mandi is to spearhead cutting edge research and development of technologies
needed by the world in the years to come. Research groups will work together in creat-
ing and harnessing the newest technologies needed to serve the people of the region and the
country, to tackle problems of global importance. In order to achieve excellence and high
impact locally and globally, IIT Mandi will strongly foster inter-disciplinary R&D. With a view to
innovating sustainable technologies for widespread use, IIT Mandi will encourage strong
Humanities and Social Sciences participation in technology R&D.

</li>

<li>Materials for electronics and electrical engineering, including
	meta-materials and nano-materials
</li>

<li>Other research areas of interest include: Structures, processes, manufacturing and
emerging materials for these; engineering design; controls; IT and network security;
networks and communications; computer vision; theoretical computer science; VLSI;
large software systems; technical communication; economics; sociology; organizational
psychology; entrepreneurship;
finance; policy studies; mathematics; statistics;
computational biology.
</li>
</ul>

<p>We are recruiting faculty in engineering, sciences and humanities who are interested in research
in any of the above areas and have a proven track record relevant to it. Individuals who combine
a strong academic record with a few years of relevant industry experience, particularly in design
and manufacturing, will be preferred.
