Dear Sir,
     we have fixed your first problem and now you can fill your surname as
required by you. Also, if you have no details to fill in for a particular page, you can skip it by clicking 'next' button at the bottom of the page. Filling in '0' is no required for such fields in the form. I hope this addresses your second query. And  regarding the third query, appropriate fields have been allocated for all the information required for shortlisting the candidates. If you do not find any field for some information, it means that information is not needed. But if you still want
to bring your post-doc to notice of recruiters, you may include it under industrial experience. 
       Feel free to contact in case your problems persist.

Regards,
Information Management Group,
IIT Mandi
