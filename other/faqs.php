<p><b><a name="Faq_1"></a>1. My browser isn&rsquo;t loading the Application form properly. What should I do?</b></p>
<p>The Application form should load properly on all browsers, but Internet Explorer(versions 6 and 7 or higher) and Safari(versions 2 and 3 or higher) have been found to be the most reliable. You can download free copies of these browsers from the Internet. This application is best viewed in 1360x768 px. or above.</p>

<p><b><a name="Faq_2"></a>2. I forgot my password. What should I do? </b></p>

<p><b><a name="Faq_3"></a>3. I did not receive the Activation email as indicated at the end of the Online Application Wizard registration process. How can I get my registration activated?</b><p>
<p>There are a number of reasons related to your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and/or email account provider that may result in loss of email correspondence from the Administration, notably:
<br/>(a)Email account quota is full.
<br/>(b)Email is directed to your Junk/Spam folder.
<br/>(c)Email with attachments are blocked by your service provider.
<br/>Please check with your ISP/email account provider. Otherwise, consider opening a free "Gmail" or "Yahoo" email account.

<p><b><a name="Faq_4"></a>4. When I paste text from a word processor into the rich text fields of the application, the system changes the formatting of my document. Is there a way to avoid this? </b></p>
<p>When completing an application component that contains a rich text field, you will notice a formatting toolbar. The farthest right button on the toolbar is a clipboard image with the letter W. Click this button, and a secondary window will appear. (You may need to modify your browser settings to enable pop-ups.) Paste the text directly from your word processor into this field, and click &ldquo;insert.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This should allow you to insert your text with minimal disruption to the formatting. We do recommend, however, that you double-check your application before submitting it.</p>

<p><b><a name="5"></a>5. Why do I get a character error message when I paste information into a restricted character fields?</b></p>
<p>When pasting text into the Application form fields from Word files, extraneous background formatting will sometimes be counted as characters resulting in an error message.&nbsp; If pasting information, you should stay well below the character limit for the field.</p>

<p><b><a name="6"></a>6.&nbsp; I do not have regular access to the Internet. May I submit a paper application?  </b></p>
<p>To avoid delays and errors, only Online Applications are accepted.</p>

<p><strong><a name="7"></a>7.&nbsp; I did not receive conformation mail after registering. What should&nbsp; I do?</strong></p>
<p>The most likely problem is that your email filter sent the email&nbsp; from the Application form to your junk mail folder.&nbsp; Please check this&nbsp; folder.&nbsp; The email may read: <i>"Thank You for ....."</i> .&nbsp; If you&nbsp; determine that it went to junk mail, you should change your email settings so that your account accepts future emails from admin@iitmandi.ac.in. If it did not go into your junk mail folder,&nbsp; please contact us at <u>techhelp@iitmandi.ac.in</u> .</p>

<p><strong><a name="8"></a>8.&nbsp; The system does not save my work. What should I do?</strong></p>
<p>This is most likely a browser issue.&nbsp; For some browsers, such as Safari and Chrome, you first need to reload or refresh the page until the toolbar above the text box is visible. You should do this before you start to enter data.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>

<p><strong><a name="9"></a>9. I have completed all of the forms.&nbsp; What should I do now?</strong></p>
<p>After you have completed all of the forms and attached any supporting documentation you would like us to consider, you must select <i>&quot;Confirm Application&quot;</i>&nbsp; in order for your application to be considered.&nbsp; After you submit your application, you will be able to print the forms from pdf generated.</p>

<p><strong><a name="11"></a>11. What should be the size of the scanned photograph?</strong></p>
